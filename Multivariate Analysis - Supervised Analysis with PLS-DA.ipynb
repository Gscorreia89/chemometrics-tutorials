After converting a column to a `Categorical` datatype, the `.codes` attribute returns a vector with the same length of the original Y, but where each value is replaced by their integer (`int`) code. The correspondence between code and category can be inspected with the `categories` attribute. The order of the labels in `.codes` is the same as the order of the `categories` attribute (i.e. 0 is the first element in `categories`, 1 the second and so on).\n",
